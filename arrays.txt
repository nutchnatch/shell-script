- store a value in array
	* x[0]="some"
	* x[1]="some"

	ar=(this is an array)
	list array:
		declare -p ar

- retrieve a value:
	* ${x[0]}:some
	* ${x[1]}:word
	${x[@]} or ${x[*]} - retrieve all values (quoting works like $*, $@)

- declare an array
	* declare -a x (or simply assign with index like above)

- initialize an array:
	* ar=(1 2 3 a b c)

- count number of elements
	* ${#array[@]}

- indices in a array
	* ${!array[@]}
	* there can be gaps in indeces, it does not care is there is a gap between index 13 an 15

- cannot export array

- bash 4 supports associative arrays
	- elements are stores and retrieced by a name, not by index
	- declare -A array - for that, they must be declared like this
